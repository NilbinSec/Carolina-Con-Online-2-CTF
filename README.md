<b> Carolina Con Online 2 CTF Writeup</b>

This repo covers NilbinSec's participation in the CTF during Carolina Con Online 2. Carolina Con is a infosec/hacking conference hosted out of North Carolina that has been online due to COVID-19. Last year, Carolina Con's CTF was NilbinSec's first CTF and this year's did not disappoint with a good mixture of entry level flags moving up to very difficult problems we were unable to solve. 

# CTF Components
The CTF was broken into the following sections with specific section write-ups in the listed folders:

**1. Brew**

**2. Crypto**

**3. File Fun**

**4. Hello World**

**5. Network**

**6. Network Theory**

**7. Obfuscation**

**8. OSINT**

**9. Pwn**

**10. Scripting**

**11. Slackware**

**12. Space Weather**

**13. Web**

# Results
NilbinSec placed 3rd overall with 1295 points! This is our best result in a CTF to date and was a significant improvement over last year when we barely broke into the top 10. Team securisec came in first place with 2238 points, and Team Oh_The_Places_Youll_Pwn came in second with 1724 points
